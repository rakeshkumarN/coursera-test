            <p>“Not many people understand what a pump is. It must be experienced to be understood. It is the greatest feeling that I get. I search for this pump because it means that that my muscles will grow when I get it. I get a pump when the blood is running into my muscles. They become really tight with blood. Like the skin is going to explode any minute. It’s like someone putting air in my muscles. It blows up. It feels fantastic.”</p>

            <p> “I’m always positive when it comes to professional bodybuilding, hell I’m Mr. Olympia for God’s sake.

            <p>“I refuse to believe today will just be another day in my life. All that I am. All that I will become will be written through my thoughts and my actions. I’ve conditioned my mind.
